// visit hackerearth and search for a problem with the same name for the problem statement

// concepts:
//     f(2k+1) = 2k+1
//     f(2k) = f(k)
//     sum of n odd numbers = n^2

// approach: 
//     among n numbers there are n/2 odd and n/2 even numbers if n is even, if n is odd there are n//2 + 1 odd numbers;
//     after we've calculate the sum of n/2 + n%2 odd numbers, there remain n//2 even numbers for each of them f(2k) = k
//     so we divide all numbers by 2, we're again left with consecutive integers from 1 to n//2 and so we repeat the same process
//     until n reduces to 0.

// the program takes O(log n) time for each test case
